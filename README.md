# Nulan-Boar-Summoner
A plugin to assist you in summoning hidden mobs in Nulan'Boar.

Plugin by Pringle with assistance from Zafrusteria and Crowley

Requires the mapper plugin enabled, the Nulan'Boar goal completed, and cexits to the Nulan'Boar master's area set up.

If your mob target is currently hiding, type nulan plus the mob's full name minus the a/an at the start to summon it. IE "nulan dull robin" but not "nulan a dull robin" Partial names do not match as there are many mobs with similar keywords.

You will need the following items from Nulan'Boar placed in a bag and not flagged kept:

(M) fur of a prairie dog (1)  
(M) badger fur (1)  
(M) a songbird feather (1)  
(M) an eagle feather (1)  
(M) Wolf tooth (1)  
(M) tail of a deer mouse (1)  
(M) a feather of a grouse (1)  
(M) a white owl feather (1)

If you are missing any, simply keep killing mobs in the area until they drop. Tokens can drop from any mob. Designate your bag by typing "nulanbag &lt;bag id&gt;"
